## Information theory

- To transmit one bit is to reduce uncertainty by a factor of 2
- Suppose the weather has 8 states. When you find the weather out, you reduce uncertainty by a factor of 8.
- Uncertainty reduction is generally 1/probability of event

$\log(\frac{1}{x}) = -\log(x)$

test $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
